# Single Page CV

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a structured, single-page CV using only **HTML**. You will focus on laying out the following sections in a clean, semantic manner:

- **Education**
- **Skills**
- **Career History**

Styling will be addressed in a later project, and for now, the focus will be entirely on structuring your content properly using HTML elements.

## Project Requirements

1. **Education Section**:

   - List your educational background in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
   - Include the name of the institution, degree, and graduation year.

2. **Skills Section**:

   - Include a list of your technical and soft skills.
   - You can organize these into categories (e.g., programming languages, software, etc.).

3. **Career History Section**:

   - List your past work experience in reverse chronological order.
   - Include the company name, job title, and duration of employment.

4. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Use proper HTML5 elements such as `<section>`, `<header>`, `<article>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
   - Ensure your structure is accessible and well-organized for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing your CV content.
- `assets/`: Folder for any assets you may want to add (e.g., images, icons).

## How to Run

This is a static HTML page, so to view it:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

### Your webpage should look like the following image:
