# HTML Form Challenge

In this lesson, I want you to create a form for an apartment search website. The form should include the following fields:

- A header at the top of the form that says "Apartment Search"
- Location (text input)
- Monthly Price (range or number input)
- Number of Bedrooms (number input)
- Number of Bathrooms (number input)
- Pets Allowed (checkbox)
- Date Available (date input)
- Submit Button

## Other Information

The range will not show the value in the UI, which is fine for this exercise.

Each input should have a corresponding label. The `id` attribute of each input should match the `for` attribute of its corresponding label.

Each input should also have a `name` attribute that corresponds to the data that will be submitted when the form is submitted.
