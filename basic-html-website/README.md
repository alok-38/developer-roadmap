# Basic HTML Website Project

## Overview

In this project, you'll create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The goal is to focus on structuring the website using semantic HTML, which can be easily styled later. Styling will be done in future projects, and for now, we'll focus purely on the layout and structure of the website.

### Project Requirements

- **Pages to Create:**
  - Homepage
  - Projects
  - Articles
  - Contact
- **Navigation Bar:**

  - A navigation bar should be present on all pages that links to the homepage, projects, articles, and contact pages.

- **SEO Meta Tags:**

  - Add basic SEO meta tags to each HTML page (such as title, description, and viewport).

- **Structure Only:**
  - Focus purely on creating the structure of the website using HTML. Do not add CSS styling in this project.

## Structure of the Website

The structure should be simple and easy to extend with styling in the future.
