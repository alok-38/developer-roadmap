              I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh and I am
              surprised how far I have come from where I started.

              Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one
              resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 0 to having a job
              and changing the financial trajectory of my family.

            I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior
            developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

          roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
          during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
          repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it
          has had on millions of lives since then.
