# Testimonial Cards

In this project, you are required to create a bunch of testimonial cards. Testimonials are quotes or statements from satisfied customers or users, often used on websites to build credibility and trust.

The goal of this project is to teach you about positioning and layout in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing some testimonial cards. Each card is designed to help you understand different layout and positioning techniques.
